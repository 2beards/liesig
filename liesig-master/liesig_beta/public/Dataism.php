      <h677>We counter ubiquitous big data with individual unique stories. We find it interesting how those sounds only the under 25s can hear, the anti loitering alarms - could be put to other use...</h677>
      <p>
        <h678><span style="color: red">In 1933</span> Poffenberger and Barrows explored how shapes and simple lines could communicate emotions. Their theory was that when we look at a line our eyes move along the shape. This turns it into a physical experience that reminds us of the body language we use to express our emotions. They asked participants to match emotions from a line to each of the 18 curved and jagged lines sloping in different directions. A line going downwards was shown to make us feel “doleful,” while a “joyous” like takes our eyes upwards.</h678>
      </p>
<h679>
      Each of our emotions contains a whole range of feelings and these nuances can also be conveyed typographically. Psychologists Samuel Juni and Julie Gross asked 102 New York University students to read a satirical article from The New York Times. Each was given the reading randomly printed in either Arial or Times New Roman. Afterwards they were asked to rate their response to what they had read. They rated the article as being funnier and angrier, in other words more satirical, when it was read in Times New Roman.</h679>
      
      <p>Type can be seen as mirroring the emotions we display in the real world through our facial expressions and gestures. When we are happy our faces become round with a wide smile and our body language is open. By contrast, an angry frown expression is pinched and angular and an attacking animal is all jagged teeth and claws. Let's integrate futuristic technology into the field of art therapy. it is time to add a digital realm to the practice.</p>
